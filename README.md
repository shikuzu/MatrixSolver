# MatrixSolver

## Version
0.0

## Description
solves matrices

## Disclamer
This project isn't finished and doesn't work yet (also the makefile is untested)

## TODO
- rework gauss algorithm by instead using the multiplication with (permutation) matrices
- implement verification if matrix is solvable
- implement user input
- implement algorithm to get matrix inverses and eigenvalues
- Implement vector operations
- probably lots more

## Build:
**Windows**
- Install Visual Studio (https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)
- open command prompt (x64 or x86)
- navigate to directory
- run "make.bat"

**Linux**:    

- install g++ (Debian or similar "apt-get install g++"  arch "pacman -S g++")
- install "make" (Debian or similar "apt-get install make"  arch "pacman -S make")
- open a terminal
